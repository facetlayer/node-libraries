Streams utility class.

A `Stream` object can receive events, and pipe them to a destination.

### Differences compared to Node.js streams ###

Compared to Node.js streams, this streams library is more opinionated and tries to do more helpful stuff.

Specific differences:

 - facetlayer/streams has a builtin event type for 'done' (meaning success), of 'fail'.
 - facetlayer/streams has builtin log events - send 'info', 'warn', or 'error' messages as part of a stream, if you want.
 - facetlayer/streams has a single .pipe() function which takes a single callback that receives StreamEvent objects, instead
   of having different listeners for different event types.

## Stream - basic usage ##

### `new Stream()` ###

Creates a new stream object.

New streams will store events in an internal buffer until they have a receiver.

### `Stream.item(item)` ###

Send a single `item` event to the stream. Items are the primary data for a stream.

### `Stream.done()` ###

Send a `done` event to the stream. This signals that the request was successful and all items were sent.

### `Stream.fail(err)` ###

Send a `fail` event to the stream. This signals that the request failed, and any items that were sent
(if any) might have been incomplete.

The `err` value will be captured as an ErrorDetails object (see "Error handling" below)

### `Stream.pipe(receiver)` ###

Hook up a receiver for the stream. Once hooked up, all backlogged events will be immediately
sent to the receiver, and any future events will be immediately sent to the receiver.

One stream can only have one receiver and the receiver can't be changed after created.

The receiver can be:

 - A function that takes a `StreamEvent` as its input.
 - An object that implements a function `.event(event: StreamEvent)`.
 - Another `Stream` instance (which has `.event`);

## Error handling ##

The library implements a class called `ErrorDetails` to help normalize handling different kinds of errors.

```
export interface ErrorDetails {
    // Unique ID assigend to this error when it's captured.
    errorId?: string
    
    // Short enum-like string to categorize the error.
    errorType?: string

    // Readable error message.
    errorMessage: string

    // Stack trace.
    stack?: any

    // Previous error that caused this one.
    cause?: ErrorDetails

    // Arbitrary related information about the error, depending on the context.
    related?: Array< Record<string, string> >
}
```

### captureError(error) ###

Captures an error and converts it into an `ErrorDetails` object.

The incoming `error` value can be one of the following:

 - A Javascript `Error` instance
   - The code will capture `.message` as `.errorMessage`, and the `.stack`.
 - An `ErrorDetails` object.
 - A string. The string will be used as the `errorMessage`.

## dynamicOutputToStream(output, stream) ##

The function `dynamicOutputToStream` turns an arbitrary value into Stream events.

One way to use this, is when implementing server endpoint handlers. When writing
a endpoint handler, you might want some to be async, some might be implemented as iterators,
and some might return streams. Using this function helps normalize the results to always produce a stream.

### Example ###

```ts
import { dynamicOutputToStream, Stream } from '@facetlayer/streams';


function* iteratorResult() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}

const iterator = iteratorResult();

// Sends the iterator result (1, 2, 3) as items to a stream.
const stream = new Stream();
dynamicOutputToStream(iterator, stream);
```

### Translation rules ###

| type | result |
| ---  | ------ |
| Falsy value | Stream is `done` with no items. |
| Array | Each item is sent to the output. |
| Stream instance | The Stream value is `pipe`d to the output. |
| Object is an iterator | Each item from the iterator is sent to the stream. |
| Object is an async iterator | Each item from the iterator is sent to the stream. |
| Object is a promise | The callback waits for the promise to resolve, and then runs the translation rules on the resul.t Of the promise rejects then the error is sent to the stream with `.fail` |
| Other object | The object is sent as a single item |

## callbackToStream(callback, stream) ##

Calls `callback` and then sends the output to the stream using `dynamicOutputToStream`.

Will also catch any uncaught errors from the callback, and send those to the stream as a `fail` event.
